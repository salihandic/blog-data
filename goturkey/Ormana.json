Situated at an altitude of 1000 meters, Ormana has held strategic importance throughout the ages. Once known as the ancient city of Erymna during the Roman period, Ormana has witnessed settlement since the Hellenistic era. It lies on the Konya-Antalya caravan route of the Seljuk Empire. This charming mountain village, home to around 600 people today, is famous for its unique ecological architecture – the 'buttoned houses' built without mortar.\n\n**Explore the Historical Buttoned Houses**\n\nOrmana offers a unique blend of history, culture, and nature. The 'buttoned houses', constructed solely from stone and cedar wood without any mortar, have withstood the test of time for centuries and are now protected as a cultural heritage site. This distinctive architectural style, found nowhere else in Anatolia, is characterized by readily available local building materials and a unique construction technique. The 'buttons' are designed to maintain wall balance, reduce wall load, and provide flexibility during earthquakes. Typically two stories high, the buttoned houses were designed with ground floors serving as barns, haylofts, or cellars due to the local population's involvement in agriculture and animal husbandry, while the upper floors were used as living spaces. The houses also feature characteristic wooden decorations.\n\n**Eynif Polyesi and Yılkı Horses**\n\nJourney to the Eynif Polyesi, a historical accommodation point on the Silk Road's Taurus crossing, and explore the ruins of the 13th-century Seljuk Tol Han. This area offers a visual feast in spring with its rich flora and fauna. Amid black pine, spruce, and fir trees, you might encounter running squirrels and rabbits, shepherd's tents, and the wild beauty of the Taurus Mountains with its 'yılkı horses'. These wild horses, descendants of cavalry units released into the wild around a century ago, continue to live in herds in their untouched natural habitat.\n\n**Unforgettable Experiences Near Ormana**\n\n*   **Ibradı Arapastı Chestnut Tree:** Visit the 1100-year-old monumental Ibradı Arapastı Chestnut Tree on the 'Melas' Valley road.\n*   **Üzümdere Creek:** Capture stunning photos and swim in the icy water, surrounded by the peaceful sounds of the river near Üzümdere village, one of the Manavgat Waterfall's mountain origin points.\n*   **Altınbeşik Cave National Park:** Discover Turkey's largest underground lake, Altınbeşik Cave, adorned with stalactites and stalagmites. The oxygen-rich and cool air inside the cave is believed to have similar effects to ozone therapy. The park surrounding the cave is home to 605 plant species, including endemic ones, and various animal species like foxes, wolves, boars, and wild goats.\n\n**Experience Local Cuisine with Yörük Culture**\n\nDiscover the flavors of Ormana, where agriculture and animal husbandry thrive. Taste dishes prepared with morel mushrooms and unique local herbs. Sample Ormana's famous grapes and pekmez (grape molasses), and consider attending the annual grape festivals held in the first week of September. Known for goats roaming the rugged Taurus slopes, Ormana offers a taste of goat cooked in a stone oven, goat meatballs, and local bread, along with goat cheese and milk for breakfast.\n\n**Ormana's Unique Handicrafts**\n\nWood carving, ironwork, and weaving continue to be important aspects of village life in Ormana. Explore Gılamık Weavings, a local silk weaving tradition, and learn about this precious handicraft from the women who still practice it.\n\n**Experience Culture While Visiting Historical Sites**\n\nEscape to Ormana for a serene holiday amidst the magnificent Taurus Mountains. Increase your positive energy by embracing cedar trees, and feel the wind on your face in the Eynif Plain.
