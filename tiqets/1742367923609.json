But where is the Sagrada Familia located, exactly? This\nstunning feat of architecture is found in central Barcelona and has quickly\nbecome a symbol of modern Spain.\n\nThe Sagrada Familia was designed by Spain’s most famous architect, Antoni Gaudí\n[https://www.tiqets.com/blog/architecture-in-barcelona/].

Gaudí is known for his dreamlike designs, use of color, and incorporating\nnature into his architecture. \n\nAlthough construction began on the Sagrada Familia back in 1882, Gaudí could\nonly complete about a quarter of the cathedral before his death in 1926.
